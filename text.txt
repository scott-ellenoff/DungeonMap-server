Rats inside the room shriek when they hear you open the door, then they run in all directions from a putrid corpse lying in the center of the floor.  There are no windows, the room is pitch black. The air tastes stale, and the entire place reeks of forgotton corpses Black mold grows in tangled veins across the walls and parts of the floor. It looks like it might be safe to travel through. A path of stone clean of mold wends its way through the hallway. The place buzzes with the strange power of an old arcane art, the likes of which your party has never encountered before. [For the DM] There is a small gathering of Goblins in the next room. Them and groups of Mutant Boars lurk throughout. Your party has been tracking an evil leprachaun for days, all clues point to this dungeon. Hopefully you will find him.. and his pot of gold.
